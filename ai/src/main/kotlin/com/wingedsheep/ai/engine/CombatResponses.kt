/**
 * What the other side of a fight can still do to it with the permanents it has on the battlefield —
 * played out, not guessed.
 *
 * [CombatAdvisor] scores an attack or a block by simulating the combat through the engine. Left to
 * itself that simulation passes priority for everyone, so it scores a world in which the opponent
 * never uses the Leonin Sun Standard sitting untapped beside two open Plains, the Prodigal Sorcerer
 * that could finish a damaged attacker, or the first-strike granter that turns a trade into a
 * blowout. An attack that only works while the blockers stay at their printed size read as safe.
 *
 * This component gives each opponent its windows back: right after attackers are declared (a
 * defender pumping or making a blocker before it blocks — the block it would then make is the
 * block predicted against the bigger board) and right after blockers are declared (either side's
 * classic trick window). At each window the opponent is offered every non-mana activated ability
 * its permanents can afford right now — the engine's own legal actions, so mana, tap costs,
 * summoning sickness, sacrifice costs and once-per-turn limits are the rules' answer rather than a
 * model of them — narrowed to the ones whose effect can touch a fight ([CombatReach]), with their
 * targets drawn from the creatures in the fight and repeatable pumps tried at each affordable
 * count. Each is simulated through the rest of combat, and the opponent takes the one that leaves
 * the AI worst off, *if* it beats passing by [MIN_GAIN]: a trick that is possible but bad for them
 * — or merely neutral — is not assumed. Greedily, so a second ability can follow the first while
 * mana remains.
 *
 * **Visible information only.** Only abilities of permanents on the battlefield are offered;
 * nothing in a hidden hand, graveyard or library is enumerated.
 *
 * **Cost.** The whole model is gated per decision ([respondersAt], cached on the decision's root
 * state): a board where no opponent has an affordable combat ability costs one enumeration per
 * decision and nothing per simulated plan. Where one does, a plan costs a bounded number of extra
 * combat simulations ([MAX_RESPONSE_SIMULATIONS]). Rollout playouts never build one.
 *
 * The comparison between two responses reads the board as it will stand once the turn is over —
 * until-end-of-turn effects and marked damage gone, and on the AI's turn the responder's lands
 * untapped — so a pump that changes nothing in the fight never looks like a gain for them, and
 * mana spent on our turn is not counted against them a second time.
