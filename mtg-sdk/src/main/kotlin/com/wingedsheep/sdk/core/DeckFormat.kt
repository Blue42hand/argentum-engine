/**
 * Constructed deck-construction formats whose legality data is sourced from Scryfall.
 *
 * A card's [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardDefinition.legalFormats] is the set of formats in
 * which the card is currently legal (i.e. not banned and printed in a legal set). Format-
 * specific deck-construction rules beyond per-card legality (Commander singleton/100, Vintage
 * restricted-list, Canadian Highlander points, etc.) are enforced separately by the deck validator.
 *
 * The two Highlander formats are the exception to "sourced from Scryfall": Scryfall publishes no
 * legality for them, so their per-card legality is derived from Vintage's (see [scryfallKey]).
