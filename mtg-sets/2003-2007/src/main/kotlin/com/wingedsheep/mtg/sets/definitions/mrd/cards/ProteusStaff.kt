/**
 * Proteus Staff
 * {3}
 * Artifact
 *
 * {2}{U}, {T}: Put target creature on the bottom of its owner's library. That creature's
 * controller reveals cards from the top of their library until they reveal a creature card. The
 * player puts that card onto the battlefield and the rest on the bottom of their library in any
 * order. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Every clause after the bottoming acts on *that creature's controller*, not on the Staff's, so
 * the whole reveal runs inside a one-player [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over [Player.ControllerOf].
 * That rebinds the resolution context's controller, which is what makes `Player.You` mean the
 * target's controller for the library being revealed *and* routes the "in any order" prompt to
 * them rather than to the Staff's controller. The reference itself stays correct even though the
 * creature has already left the battlefield: the engine falls back to the entity's
 * last-known-permanent snapshot.
 *
 * Inside that scope the reveal is the `revealUntilMatchToHand` shape with a different landing
 * zone: gather until the first creature card, reveal the whole pile, then split it — the single
 * match onto the battlefield, everything revealed before it to the bottom of the library, under
 * the target itself since it was bottomed first. That ordering is also why a library holding no
 * *other* creature card finds the bottomed target and puts it straight back.
