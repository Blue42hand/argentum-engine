/**
 * Brokers Hideout — Streets of New Capenna #248. One of SNC's family fetch lands.
 *
 * When this land enters, sacrifice it. When you do, search your library for a basic Forest,
 * Plains, or Island card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * The sacrifice is gated on the land still being on the battlefield: if it left before the
 * enters trigger resolved, it can't be sacrificed, so the reflexive "when you do" never triggers.
