/**
 * Batterhorn
 * {4}{R}
 * Creature — Beast
 * 4/3
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may destroy target artifact.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Return to Ravnica, the card's earliest real printing.
 *
 * "You may" on a triggered ability is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a
 * `Effects.May` around the declared effect — one consent gate, asked at resolution. The target is
 * still chosen when the ability goes on the stack, so declining wastes the choice (CR 603.3d).
