/**
 * Ghostly Touch
 * {1}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, you may tap or untap target permanent."
 *
 * The Contaminated Bond shape: the quoted trigger is granted *to* the enchanted creature via
 * [GrantTriggeredAbility] (default attached-creature filter) with [Triggers.Attacks]' own event and
 * SELF binding passed through verbatim. An ATTACHED-bound attack trigger is not indexed by the
 * engine, so installing it on the creature is what makes it fire; it also puts "you" on the
 * creature's controller, which is the printed reading of a granted ability.
 *
 * "Tap or untap" is the Pestermite idiom — a [Effects.May] over a two-[Mode] [ModalEffect] with
 * `countsAsModalSpell = false`, since the choice is made on resolution and is not CR 700.2
 * modality. The permanent is targeted when the trigger goes on the stack; the direction is chosen
 * afterwards, so an opponent responding by tapping it doesn't strand you on the dead half.
