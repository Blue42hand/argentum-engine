 * Soul Separator
 * {3}
 * Artifact
 * {5}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Exile target creature card from your graveyard. Create a token
 * that's a copy of that card, except it's 1/1, it's a Spirit in addition to its other types, and it
 * has flying. Create a black Zombie creature token with power equal to that card's power and
 * toughness equal to that card's toughness.
 *
 * Modeled after Sauron, the Necromancer: exile the targeted graveyard creature card, then reference
 * "that card" (its [CardComponent] survives the move to exile) via [EffectTarget.ContextTarget].
 * - The copy token uses `overridePower`/`overrideToughness = 1` for the 1/1, `addedSubtypes` for
 *   "Spirit in addition to its other types", and `addedKeywords` for flying.
 * - The Zombie token's power/toughness are read from the exiled card's printed base stats via
 *   [DynamicAmount.EntityProperty] (a card outside the battlefield shows its printed characteristics).
