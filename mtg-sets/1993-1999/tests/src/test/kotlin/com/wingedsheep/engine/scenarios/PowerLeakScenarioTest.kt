/**
 * Scenario tests for Power Leak.
 *
 * Enchant enchantment. At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted enchantment's controller, that
 * player may pay any amount of mana. This Aura deals 2 damage to that player. Prevent X of that
 * damage, where X is the amount of mana that player paid this way.
 *
 * The trigger is the Aura's (its controller controls it), but the step, the payment and the
 * damage all belong to the enchanted enchantment's controller. X is real prevention: a
 * single-instance shield from this Aura, spent by the 2 damage even when X exceeds it.
