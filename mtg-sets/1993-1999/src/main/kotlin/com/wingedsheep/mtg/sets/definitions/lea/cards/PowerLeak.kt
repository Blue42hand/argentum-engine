/**
 * Power Leak
 * {1}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant enchantment
 * At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted enchantment's controller, that player may pay any
 * amount of mana. This Aura deals 2 damage to that player. Prevent X of that damage, where X is the
 * amount of mana that player paid this way.
 *
 * Modelling: the step belongs to the enchanted enchantment's controller but the trigger stays the
 * Aura's (`Triggers.attached`); "that player" is the triggering player, who also chooses and pays X
 * (`MayPayX` with that player as decision-maker). The paid X becomes a real prevention shield —
 * so "damage can't be prevented" beats it — covering only the next instance from this Aura to that
 * player, installed before the 2 damage and spent by it, so overpaying never lingers.
