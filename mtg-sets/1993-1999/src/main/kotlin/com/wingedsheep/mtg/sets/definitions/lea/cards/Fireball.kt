/**
 * Fireball — Limited Edition Alpha #149
 * {X}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * This spell costs {1} more to cast for each target beyond the first.
 * Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any number of targets.
 *
 * *The tax* is the generic sibling of Officious Interrogation's: a self-cast [ModifySpellCost]
 * whose count source is [CostReductionSource.ChosenTargetsBeyondTheFirst]. It is a cost increase,
 * so a free cast still owes it (CR 601.2f), and it never touches the mana value.
 *
 * *The division* happens on resolution with no choices: each target still legal then takes
 * floor(X / N), N being how many targets are still legal. The resolver hands the effect only the
 * still-legal targets (CR 608.2b), so `targetCount()` read *before* the per-target loop is exactly N.
 * It must be frozen with `StoreNumber` first — inside `ForEachTarget` the context holds only the one
 * target being visited, so a count read there would always be 1. With more legal targets than X
 * the share is 0 and nothing is dealt damage. With zero targets the spell isn't targeted at all and
 * simply resolves doing nothing (the share is 0 — a division by zero reads 0).
