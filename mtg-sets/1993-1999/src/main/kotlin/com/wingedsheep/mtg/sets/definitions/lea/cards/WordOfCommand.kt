/**
 * Word of Command
 * {B}{B}
 * Instant
 * Look at target opponent's hand and choose a card from it. You control that player until Word of
 * Command finishes resolving. The player plays that card if able. While doing so, the player can
 * activate mana abilities only if they're from lands that player controls and only if mana they
 * produce is spent to activate other mana abilities of lands the player controls and/or to play
 * that card. If the chosen card is cast as a spell, you control the player while that spell is
 * resolving.
 *
 * Any card may be chosen; an unplayable choice simply does nothing ("if able"). A land is played
 * only on that player's turn with a land play left, using the ordinary land-play rules.
