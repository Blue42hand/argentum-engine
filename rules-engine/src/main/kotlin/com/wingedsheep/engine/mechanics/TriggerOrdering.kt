/**
 * CR 603.3b: each player, in APNAP order, puts the triggered abilities they control on the stack
 * in any order they choose. A player who turned automatic ordering off
 * ([GameState.manualTriggerOrdering]) is asked for that order, before any of the abilities chooses
 * targets (CR 603.3d); everyone else's abilities go on in the [suggested] order — the order they
 * triggered in, except that an ability checking this turn's history as it resolves goes last.
 *
 * The [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.Settler] asks once per wave, so each of 603.3b's two parts (the
 * abilities that trigger on an attack-caused ability triggering come second) gets its own question.
 * The wave waits, already in APNAP order, in [GameState.triggersBeingPlaced]: an answer only
 * rearranges its player's part of it, and the drain after the last answer places it unchanged.
