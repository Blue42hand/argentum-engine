/**
 * Settles a finished game played for ante: which cards end up owned by someone other than the
 * player whose deck they started in. Ante is played "for keeps" (CR 407.1), so this is what the
 * server carries out of the game — into a Limited tournament's pools, or a player's spoils.
 *
 * Two things move a card:
 * - **The ante pot.** "At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in
 *   the ante zone" (CR 407.2). With no winner — a draw — nobody takes it, and every card in the
 *   ante stays with whoever owns it.
 * - **Ownership changes during the game.** Darkpact and Bronze Tablet change a card's owner
 *   (CR 407.3); `ChangeOwnershipExecutor` remembers the first owner on the card.
 *
 * Both reduce to one comparison per card: its owner at the end, after the winner takes the ante,
 * against its owner when the game began. A card that changed hands and came back reports nothing.
 * Tokens are never owned "for keeps", so they're skipped.
