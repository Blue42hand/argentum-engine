/**
 * Renders a [PendingDecision] for one viewer, hiding the identity of every face-down object that
 * viewer may not look under.
 *
 * Decisions are built once, from the engine's full state, and some of them reach more than one
 * player: the combat-damage board goes to both choosers, and a selection can offer an opponent's
 * face-down creatures (Stand or Fall's piles). The engine therefore records real names and ids,
 * and every consumer that shows a decision to a player — the game server, a replay, an
 * observation — renders it through here. Each answer comes from [Visibility.cardNameFor], so a
 * reveal, a "look at face-down creatures" static, or CR 708.5's controller access is honoured
 * exactly as the client state honours it.
 *
 * A source marked [DecisionContext.sourceIsPrivate] — a card in a hidden zone the question does
 * not reveal — is masked as well, to anyone who may not see that card: its name is dropped
 * rather than replaced, since there is no face-down label to show for a card in a hand.
 *
 * Masked fields: [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.DecisionContext]`.sourceName` on any decision, the
 * combat board's nodes and prompt, and the `cardInfo` maps. Other prompts are not rewritten: they
 * are built for their chooser, who controls the source they name. A new decision that names an
 * object to a player who may not see it must mask that text here too.
