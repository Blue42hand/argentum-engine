/**
 * Runs an effect tree as an [EffectProgram]: walks [CompositeEffect] sequences itself and runs
 * every other node (a *leaf*) through [effectExecutor].
 *
 * **Pausing never changes the outcome.** A run that pauses and resumes does exactly what the same
 * run does when nothing pauses, because the frame's cursor is a zipper: every open composite's
 * step holds an exact delta ([CursorStep.Child.delta]) from which the context it was entered with
 * is rebuilt, and leaving a composite goes through one function ([Run.leave]) on both paths. A
 * scope's delta and the steps around it are computed once when it opens, so the frame pushed
 * beneath each leaf costs one step, not one per depth.
 *
 * **Running.** From the cursor:
 * 1. A composite opens a scope (its entry context, one resolution depth deeper when nested) and
 *    descends to its first child; an empty one has finished.
 * 2. A leaf gets the program pushed beneath it, cursor **at that leaf**, then runs. If it pauses,
 *    the pause propagates with the frame waiting beneath the leaf's own frames. If it finishes, the
 *    frame is dropped and its result is folded into the context ([foldResult]); if it fails, it is
 *    skipped — unless its composite has `stopOnError`, which abandons the rest of that one
 *    composite (only that one: a nested composite without the flag absorbs its own failures).
 *    Either way the object moves a failed leaf or an abandoned composite made stay followable.
 *    The frame popped after a leaf must be the one pushed beneath it; a value the leaf handed to
 *    "the frame beneath" without pausing is taken from it, as a resumer's hand-off would be.
 * 3. Advancing goes to the next sibling, or leaves the composite and moves on to its next sibling.
 *    Leaving hands the parent its entry context plus what the composite stored — new pipeline keys
 *    (a value shadowing an outer key doesn't escape), appended snapshots, and the object moves its
 *    events authorise. Leaving the root yields the program's [outputs] against its true base.
 *
 * **Resuming** ([resume]): the node at the cursor has finished; its outputs are in the frame's
 * context. The scopes are rebuilt from the cursor's steps and the run advances past it. The
 * finished program's outputs are what [run] would have returned; the automatic resumer publishes
 * them to the frame beneath.
 *
 * @param effectExecutor how a leaf runs: the registry's `execute`, which labels it
 *   ([originFor]) and leaves the resolution depth alone — the context already carries it.
