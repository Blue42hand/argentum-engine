/**
 * Chokepoint for *ad-hoc* battlefield insertions (token creation, land play, permanent-
 * spell resolution, returns from linked exile, etc.).
 *
 * Wraps [GameState.addToZone] for the controller's battlefield and fires the per-turn
 * [PermanentEntryTracker] so that "an X entered the battlefield this turn" conditions
 * stay in sync — calling `addToZone(battlefieldZone, …)` directly from such a path bypasses
 * the tracker and is the recurring source of subtle "card silently can't satisfy its own
 * condition" bugs. Use this helper instead.
 *
 * The standard zone-change pipeline ([ZoneTransitionService.moveToZone]) does **not** route
 * through here: it has to record *after* [ZoneTransitionService.applyBattlefieldEntry] wires
 * the controller, so it calls [PermanentEntryTracker.record] directly instead.
 *
 * The entity must already carry the components that define its identity at entry
 * (`CardComponent`, `ControllerComponent`, etc.) — the tracker reads projected types
 * after the entity is in the zone.
 *
 * [BattlefieldEntry.place] does **not** run ETB replacement effects, set tapped state,
 * apply enters-with-counters, or emit a `ZoneChangeEvent`. Those are the caller's job
 * (or [ZoneTransitionService.moveToZone]'s, for the standard zone-change pipeline).
