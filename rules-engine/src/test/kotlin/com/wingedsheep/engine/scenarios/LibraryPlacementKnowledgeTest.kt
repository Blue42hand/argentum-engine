/**
 * Who is allowed to keep seeing a card once it has been put into a library.
 *
 * CR 401.2 stops a player looking *through* a library; it does not erase what they just watched go
 * in. Every library entry in the engine funnels through `ZoneTransitionService`, which asks
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.effects.library.LibraryRevealUtils.placementAudience] the single
 * question "who knows this slot?" and **replaces** the card's audience with the answer:
 *
 *  - a random position (shuffle) — nobody;
 *  - out of a public zone, or revealed on the way in — the whole table;
 *  - otherwise (out of a hand) — only the player who chose the card and saw where it landed.
 *
 * Replacing rather than merging is what stops a leak: a card the whole table knew while it sat in
 * a hand goes dark again the moment it is tucked away. That is why
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.RevealedInHandTracker] no longer clears reveals for cards
 * leaving a hand *for a library* — this seam has already given the authoritative answer, and the
 * tracker's old blanket clear wiped it, blinding the player to their own put-back.
