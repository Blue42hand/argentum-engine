/**
 * DeckPickerModal — the shell every "what does this seat bring?" dialog opens in.
 *
 * There were four of these: the quick lobby's own seat and the premade-decks tournament seat shared
 * one, the quick lobby's AI seat had a near-copy, and the pod's AI seat used the generic confirm
 * panel with a hand-tuned `maxWidth`. So the same question arrived in three different sizes
 * depending on which seat you clicked. One shell, one header, one Done button.
 *
 * Named for the seat it belongs to (`title`) with one line of orientation under it (`subtitle`),
 * because these are always opened *from a player row* and the first thing to be sure of is whose
 * deck is about to change.
 *
 * The footer can carry the lobby's next step (`primary`) — "Ready up", or "Start game" against the
 * AI — so picking a deck and committing to it is one motion rather than Done, find the action bar,
 * press Ready. Done stays beside it for when you only came to look.
